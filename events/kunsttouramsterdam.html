        <p>By participating in this activity, we will take you along the most beautiful sights of Amsterdam. Get to know the history and culture on this 2.5-hour walking tour. Walk past the romantic canals and walk across Spui to get to the pearl of Amsterdam. With itâ€™s entrance tucked away in a narrow side street, this very special courtyard is just waiting to be explored. On the way back to Dam Square you will see the river from which the city owes its name: the Amstel. The city tour ends at the National Monument, which was originally built to commemorate the victims of World War II, but is now a memorial to all those who lost their lives in war around the world.</p>
